# weechat_scratchpad
Simple python script that opens a scratchpad buffer to take notes, etc...

To open it, just type
```
/scratchpad
```

You can now write everything you want in here. Logs are available in:
```
~/.weechat/logs/python.scratchpad.weechatlog
```

That is a normal buffer, and can thus be moved or closed like any other buffers
